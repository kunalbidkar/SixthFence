# SixthFence (Weekend of Innovation)

## Problem Definition

This application is divided into two parts. 
Part A - Generate popups to the user about the point of interests near him in a park as his location updates. (Location simulated with few pre-defined latitude and longitude points. The application runs through a script that loops through the points which checks if the current location lies within the boundary of point of interests co-cordinates and if the location comes in the boundary, generate a Popup / Infowindow)
Part B - User notification via email to the registered users about any alert/accident at a certain point in the park. (Ex: Wild animal spotted in the park, so you wish to update visitors through an email alert to avoid them visting that area for their safety.

## Getting Started

These instructions will get you a copy of the project up and running on your local machine for development and testing purposes. 
Here is the link to a Story Map used to present this project:

### Prerequisites

What things you need to use this project : 
Web Server : (XAMPP) or any other

### Installing and Running

A step by step series of examples that tell you how to get a development env running

-If you have a web server like XAMPP, clone the folder and copy paste it into the htdocs folder of XAMPP.
-Go to the control panel of your web server and start it. Once your server is started, you can to the browser
 and type localhost:8080/intern/intro.html
  -8080 is the port number and it might vary if you have the web server running on a different port number
  -intern is the name of the cloned folder (Project Folder Name)
-Once you enter this URL, a logo will appear for 3 seconds (splash screen) and then it will be redirected to index.html
